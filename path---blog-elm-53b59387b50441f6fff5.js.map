Elm is pretty well known for their documentation, and many technologies with higher barriers to entry have to so that people use their tools. I started at zero with the tutorial on their website and quickly progressed through the more standard parts of the language. There were some interesting syntactical choices — like the pipes for changing record attributes. I also found it interesting that their standard collection is a linked list instead of an array.

I felt like it jumped from 0–100 really fast in this part. I definitely got a little bit lost here. Overall, though, the design pattern of model, update, view, subscriptions made sense.

In Elm’s compiling process it makes sure that there won’t be any runtime errors. This process means you have really good, clear error messages before your code runs. I also really like the “time travel” functionality where you can see your application’s state at various points. These parts of the development experience are great, and I can see why other tools (such as Redux) have built off of these ideas.</p>\\n<p>After looking through the “Elm Architecture” portion of the tutorial, I was able to step by step walk myself through the code, but I was still really struggling to write my own Elm code from scratch. I ended up looking at some other projects that I found on Github such as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/w0rm/elm-flatris\\\">Flatris</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dstoeckel/hanoi/blob/master/Hanoi.elm\\\">Elm Hanoi</a>.</p>\\n<p>From there I found <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2CkojtxFw\\\">Tensor Programming’s Elm tutorial</a> which ended up helping a lot. I really like the follow along style of learning, so this tutorial was really helpful for that.</p>\\n<h2>The Final Project</h2>\\n<p>I originally wanted to build Towers of Hanoi in Elm since it is a pretty easy JavaScript game to write; however, I found it still a bit out of my league in Elm. I instead scaled down and wrote a trivia app, which was still pretty tricky.</p>\\n<p>I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app\\\">create-elm-app</a> which is very similar to create-react-app. It was very helpful for both development and deployment. There were still a few things that I had to figure out in my code. First was the linked list vs. array issue. I ended up using the linked list and iterating through it to retrieve different questions. In other languages I would have kept an index value and used that to move from question to question. The architecture of the program was a bit different in Elm.</p>\\n<p>I also found working with “maybes” difficult. Maybes are a datatype in Elm similar to a string, integer, or list that can be “Nothing” — similar to null or None in other languages — or have a value. In order to work with the value, if it exists, you must take it out of the maybe. It makes sense from a strictly typed perspective and a functional perspective, but it makes the code somewhat clunky.</p>\\n<h4>Example Maybe Handling</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-elm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-elm\\\"><span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">currentQuestion</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token constant\\\">Maybe</span> <span class=\\\"token constant\\\">Question</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">-></span> <span class=\\\"token constant\\\">Question</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">currentQuestion</span> <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">question</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> \\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">case</span> <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">question</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">of</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token constant\\\">Just</span> <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">question</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">-></span>\\n            <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">question</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token constant\\\">Nothing</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">-></span>\\n            <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">question</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"\\\"</span>\\n            <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">answers</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n            <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token hvariable\\\">correctAnswer</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"\\\"</span>\\n            <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Eventually, I did come up with a MVP trivia application that asks questions, lets users click buttons with the different answers, and then keeps track of how many questions were answered correctly.
