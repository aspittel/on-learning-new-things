I though these tips could be helpful for people here as well!</p>\n<h2>Why Blog?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinforce your knowledge on topics.

There will be more beginners than experts in most cases, so that audience will be bigger!</li>\n<li>Tone - be conversational and casual in your blog posts. Those posts tend to spark the most discussion and engage readers the most. Explain jargon and explain tricky topics in greater detail.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>lots</strong> of code samples, links, pictures, and embeds in your posts. Break up the text!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Beating Writers Block</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Having a topic for your blog should help.</li>\n<li>Reach out to your social media networks and see what posts they want.</li>\n<li>Keep a list of future articles when you think of them.
